Week One:

I wanted to get more done, but I ran into some problems and time constraints. I was having a visual error, but was able to fix it. 
However, I only had time to setup the gameboard. I was starting to implement some buttons, but I realized soon after that I would 
need 100 buttons. I found ofxMSAInteractiveObjects, but it said it could not find it. Also, I have been trying to figure out 
multi-windows, so everything is not in the ofApp.cpp and ofApp.h.


Week Two:

I decided not to use buttons and now I am using mousepressed. I have created all the player boards and have been working on the transition from player 1 to player 2. I also have been having trouble trying to let the players chose there own piece location so I have have created preset location. I might be able to change this but I am not sure. I do not think it will be a good to have the delay. The game will take to long. Also I do not think the homepage is needed.

Week Three:

Once a player destroys all the ships I added an end screen letting the players know the game was over. There is also a fluid transition between the attack and the players own ships. Also once the player chooses there spot it is locked and the switch to the ships now becomes the end of the turn. I tried to make a reset but it took longer than I thought so I could not implement it properly.
